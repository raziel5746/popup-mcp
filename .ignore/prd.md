# popup-mcp Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable AI coding assistants to trigger interactive popup dialogs in VS Code for structured user responses, reducing context switching.
- Provide accurate popup routing across multiple VS Code instances using workspace path detection.
- Support both HTTP and stdio protocols with zero-configuration setup.
- Enhance overall coding efficiency by transforming AIs into interactive pair programmers through button-based interactions.

### Background Context
In the current AI-assisted coding landscape, assistants like GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, and Cline are confined to chat-based interactions, leading to workflow disruptions during critical decision-making moments. Developers experience cognitive overload from context switching to type responses, which can reduce efficiency by up to 40%. This extension addresses these issues by enabling popups that allow for quick, structured decisions without breaking focus.

The solution introduces an MCP server within VS Code that handles popup requests, routes them to the correct instance based on workspace paths, and captures button responses seamlessly. Popups will include customizable buttons and an option for free text input, allowing users to provide responses not covered by predefined options. This innovation positions AIs as true pair programmers, supporting use cases like architecture choices, deployment confirmations, and learning interactions, ultimately creating a more immersive coding experience.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The extension aims to provide a seamless, non-intrusive UI that integrates naturally with VS Code, minimizing disruption while enabling quick AI interactions via popups. Popups will be built using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript/JavaScript, displayed in a new VS Code tab rather than native modals. The focus is on low-friction, context-preserving decision-making that feels like a natural part of the editor experience, with safeguards against over-intrusiveness.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- Modal popup dialogs for immediate, structured decisions with customizable buttons and free text input.
- Passive status bar indicator for MCP connection state without requiring user attention.
- Automatic server/client coordination with graceful handling of edge cases.
- Zero-configuration setup, leveraging VS Code APIs for workspace detection.
- User-configurable settings for popup behavior (e.g., frequency caps, auto-dismiss rules, theme integration) to prevent workflow disruptions.
- Configurable chime notification for popups, toggleable via status bar and settings.

### Core Screens and Views
- Popup Dialog: A modal window with title, message, action buttons, and optional text input field.
- Status Bar Item: A persistent icon indicator showing MCP role and connection status, with detailed text on hover; includes a mute/unmute button for popup chime.
- Settings Panel: Extension settings for customizing popup behaviors, preferences, and chime on/off option.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Standard accessibility compliance to ensure usability for a broad range of developers, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support for popups, and testing across diverse user setups.

### Branding
Implement a custom, modern, and minimalistic AI-looking style for popups to make them distinguishable from the rest of the IDE, while ensuring they do not clash with VS Code themes.

### Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform
VS Code desktop on Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring consistent experience across operating systems with platform-specific testing.

**Detailed Rationale:**
- **Trade-offs and Choices**: Opted for minimal UI elements to keep the extension lightweight, choosing popups over more complex interfaces to avoid overwhelming the user. Selected WCAG AA over AAA to balance accessibility with development effort for MVP, while adding configurable settings to mitigate intrusiveness risks.
- **Key Assumptions**: Assumed integration with VS Code's existing UI components will suffice; based on project brief's emphasis on desktop VS Code environments. Assumes early testing will validate multi-platform consistency.
- **Interesting Decisions**: Limited core views to popup, status bar, and settings to prioritize simplicity, with configurability added to address potential over-use; chose cross-platform without mobile support as VS Code is primarily desktop.
- **Areas Needing Validation**: Confirm if additional accessibility features are needed; custom themes or theme selection will be required in future versions but not for MVP; verify if status bar and configs are sufficient for all status information; conduct beta testing for intrusiveness and edge cases.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all code for the extension, including src/ for core logic, tests/, and package.json for packaging. Rationale: Simplifies development and dependency management for a focused VS Code extension project, aligning with MVP scope for quick iterations.

### Service Architecture
Single MCP server instance with client extensions for multi-instance coordination, built using Node.js. This monolith approach keeps everything self-contained within VS Code, avoiding distributed system complexities. Rationale: Matches the project's need for zero-configuration and low overhead; a monolith is sufficient for MVP as there's no need for scalable, independent services.

### Testing Requirements
Unit + Integration testing, focusing on core components like popup routing and MCP communication. Include manual testing for UI interactions. Rationale: Balances thoroughness with MVP timeline; unit tests cover logic, integration tests verify end-to-end flows, while full e2e might be overkill initially but can be added post-MVP.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Languages/Frameworks**: TypeScript for frontend/UI using VS Code Extension API; Node.js for backend/server logic.
- **Database**: None required; use local storage if needed for configurations.
- **Hosting/Infrastructure**: Self-hosted within VS Code; no external servers.
- **Integration**: API hooks via HTTP/stdio; leverage VS Code API for workspace detection. AI assistants must include the workspace path when sending popup data for accurate routing. Requires configuration in AI assistant's MCP JSON file (e.g., for HTTP: {"popup-mcp": {"url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp", "type": "html"}}; for stdio: {"popup-mcp": {"command": "node", "args": ["path/to/extension/dist/index.js"]}}).
- **Security**: No data collection without consent; follow VS Code guidelines.
- **Performance**: Low latency (under 50ms for popups) with minimal resource usage.

**Detailed Rationale:**
- **Trade-offs and Choices**: Chose monorepo over polyrepo for simplicity in a small project, trading potential modularity for easier maintenance. Opted for monolith architecture instead of microservices to minimize complexity and deployment overhead, suitable for an extension without scaling needs.
- **Key Assumptions**: Based on project brief's preferences; assumes VS Code API stability and no major changes. For unknowns, guided by MVP scope emphasizing lightweight, cross-platform compatibility.
- **Interesting Decisions**: Limited testing to unit + integration to accelerate development, potentially risking undetected UI bugsâ€”mitigated by manual checks. No database keeps things simple, assuming configs can be handled locally.
- **Areas Needing Validation**: Confirm if additional libraries (e.g., for HTTP handling) are needed; verify performance across OSes; check if security assumptions cover all popup data scenarios.
