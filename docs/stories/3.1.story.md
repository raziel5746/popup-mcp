## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** extension settings for customizing popup behaviors, including chime on/off, frequency caps, and auto-dismiss rules,  
**so that** I can tailor the experience to my needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Adds settings panel with options for chime toggle, popup limits, and other behaviors.  
2: Settings persist and apply immediately.  
3: Integrates with status bar mute button for chime.  
4: Documents settings in README or help command.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add extension settings (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/components.md#settings-manager]  
  - [ ] Define settings in package.json  
  - [ ] Implement SettingsManager to read/update  
- [ ] Ensure persistence and immediate apply (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
