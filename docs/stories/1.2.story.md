# Story 1.2: Create Detailed Development Environment Guide

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a comprehensive guide for setting up the local dev environment, including tools, versions, and dependencies,  
**so that** onboarding is smooth and consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Document required tools (e.g., Node.js, vsce) with versions.  
2: Step-by-step install and config instructions in README or docs.  
3: Verify against NFR2 (VS Code 1.70+ compatibility).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Review tech stack documentation to compile list of required tools and versions (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]  
  - [x] Extract frontend, backend, testing, and build tools with exact versions  
  - [x] Note any prerequisites like OS compatibility  
- [x] Create or update README.md with development setup section (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
  - [x] Add step-by-step instructions for installing Node.js, TypeScript, vsce, and other dependencies  
  - [x] Include commands for cloning repo, npm install, and initial build  
  - [x] Document environment variable setup if needed  
- [x] Add verification steps in the guide (AC: 3)  
  - [x] Include check for VS Code version >=1.70  
  - [x] Add basic smoke test: run extension and verify MCP server starts  
- [x] Ensure guide aligns with coding standards for documentation (AC: all) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]  
  - [x] Use consistent formatting, markdown best practices  
- [x] Test the guide manually by following steps in a clean environment (AC: all)  
  - [x] Document any issues found and iterate on the guide  

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**: No previous implementation notes available, as Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record is empty.  
- **Data Models**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.  
- **API Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.  
- **Component Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.  
- **File Locations**: Place the development guide in README.md at project root, or create a new docs/development-setup.md if more detailed. Follow unified project structure for any new files. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
- **Testing Requirements**: For documentation tasks, include manual verification steps to ensure the guide works; no automated tests required unless adding scripts. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]  
- **Technical Constraints**: Use specified versions: TypeScript 5.3.x, Node.js 20.x LTS, esbuild 0.20.x, vsce latest, Jest 29.x, Playwright 1.41.x; ensure compatibility with VS Code 1.70+ (per AC3). [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]  

**Project Structure Notes**: The guide must reference the unified project structure, ensuring instructions align with file locations like src/, tests/, and assets/. No discrepancies noted.

### Testing
- Test file location: N/A for documentation story.  
- Test standards: Manual testing to verify setup guide accuracy; follow testing pyramid principles if adding any scripts. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]  
- Testing frameworks and patterns: Use Jest for any related unit tests if needed (e.g., config validation), but not required here. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]  
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Include a section in the guide for users to verify setup via a simple extension run command.

## QA Results

### Review Date: August 10, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

**Overall Assessment**: This story demonstrates exceptional attention to detail and comprehensive implementation that exceeds acceptance criteria expectations.

#### Code Quality Excellence
- **Documentation Standards**: README follows professional technical writing standards with clear structure, comprehensive coverage, and excellent formatting
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration properly documented with explicit version requirements (5.3.x)
- **Testing Implementation**: Project structure validation test is well-architected with proper assertions and comprehensive coverage
- **Error Handling**: Troubleshooting section proactively addresses common setup issues with specific solutions

#### Implementation Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Tool Coverage**: All required tools documented with exact versions matching tech stack specifications
2. **Step-by-Step Excellence**: Installation guide is exceptionally detailed with verification commands for each step
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: OS compatibility clearly documented (Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 18.04+)
4. **Developer Experience**: IDE configuration recommendations and workspace settings enhance productivity
5. **Verification Robustness**: 8-point verification checklist ensures setup success
6. **Future-Proofing**: Integration notes for upcoming Story 1.3 demonstrate architectural thinking

#### Testing & Validation
- **Automated Validation**: Project structure test passes successfully (5/5 tests)
- **Manual Testing**: Dev Agent Record indicates thorough manual verification on Windows environment
- **Test Architecture**: Proper Jest configuration with TypeScript integration

#### Architectural Compliance
- **Tech Stack Alignment**: Perfect adherence to specified versions (Node.js 20.x LTS, TypeScript 5.3.x, etc.)
- **Coding Standards**: Documentation follows established naming conventions and formatting guidelines
- **Project Structure**: README structure aligns with unified project architecture

#### Minor Observations (No Action Required)
- Repository URL placeholder in clone command is appropriate for current development phase
- VS Code settings section correctly notes Story 1.3 dependency
- Package.json scripts documentation appropriately references future implementation

#### Security & Performance Considerations
- No security vulnerabilities in documented setup process
- Performance-conscious tool selections (esbuild over webpack, minimal dependencies)
- Proper version pinning prevents supply chain risks

**Recommendation**: This implementation sets an excellent standard for documentation quality and should be used as a template for future documentation stories.

**Risk Assessment**: LOW - Implementation is production-ready with comprehensive validation
