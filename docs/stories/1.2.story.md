# Story 1.2: Create Detailed Development Environment Guide

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a comprehensive guide for setting up the local dev environment, including tools, versions, and dependencies,  
**so that** onboarding is smooth and consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Document required tools (e.g., Node.js, vsce) with versions.  
2: Step-by-step install and config instructions in README or docs.  
3: Verify against NFR2 (VS Code 1.70+ compatibility).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Review tech stack documentation to compile list of required tools and versions (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]  
  - [x] Extract frontend, backend, testing, and build tools with exact versions  
  - [x] Note any prerequisites like OS compatibility  
- [x] Create or update README.md with development setup section (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
  - [x] Add step-by-step instructions for installing Node.js, TypeScript, vsce, and other dependencies  
  - [x] Include commands for cloning repo, npm install, and initial build  
  - [x] Document environment variable setup if needed  
- [x] Add verification steps in the guide (AC: 3)  
  - [x] Include check for VS Code version >=1.70  
  - [x] Add basic smoke test: run extension and verify MCP server starts  
- [x] Ensure guide aligns with coding standards for documentation (AC: all) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]  
  - [x] Use consistent formatting, markdown best practices  
- [x] Test the guide manually by following steps in a clean environment (AC: all)  
  - [x] Document any issues found and iterate on the guide  

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**: No previous implementation notes available, as Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record is empty.  
- **Data Models**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.  
- **API Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.  
- **Component Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.  
- **File Locations**: Place the development guide in README.md at project root, or create a new docs/development-setup.md if more detailed. Follow unified project structure for any new files. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
- **Testing Requirements**: For documentation tasks, include manual verification steps to ensure the guide works; no automated tests required unless adding scripts. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]  
- **Technical Constraints**: Use specified versions: TypeScript 5.3.x, Node.js 20.x LTS, esbuild 0.20.x, vsce latest, Jest 29.x, Playwright 1.41.x; ensure compatibility with VS Code 1.70+ (per AC3). [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]  

**Project Structure Notes**: The guide must reference the unified project structure, ensuring instructions align with file locations like src/, tests/, and assets/. No discrepancies noted.

### Testing
- Test file location: N/A for documentation story.  
- Test standards: Manual testing to verify setup guide accuracy; follow testing pyramid principles if adding any scripts. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]  
- Testing frameworks and patterns: Use Jest for any related unit tests if needed (e.g., config validation), but not required here. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]  
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Include a section in the guide for users to verify setup via a simple extension run command.
