# Story 1.4: Implement Basic Popup Display

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** popups to display in a new VS Code tab with custom title, message, buttons, and free text input,  
**so that** I can interact with AI-triggered dialogs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Popup renders as HTML/CSS/TS in a new tab simulating a modal.  
2: Displays provided title, message, buttons, and optional text field.  
3: Applies custom modern minimalistic AI style without clashing with VS Code themes.  
4: Plays a provided WAV file as chime sound on display (if not muted).  
5: Local testability via command or sample request.  
6: Displays the workspace path in the popup for debugging purposes.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Create src/components/PopupWebview.ts using VS Code WebviewPanel  
  - [ ] Render HTML with title, message, buttons, and text input from PopupRequest  
- [ ] Add custom styling (AC: 3) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#css-framework]  
  - [ ] Develop minimal CSS in views/popup.html that adapts to VS Code themes  
  - [ ] Ensure modern, AI-like design (e.g., clean fonts, subtle animations)  
- [ ] Integrate chime playback (AC: 4) [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#assets]  
  - [ ] Create utils/chimePlayer.ts to play assets/chime.wav  
  - [ ] Check ExtensionConfig for mute status before playing  
- [ ] Add debug features (AC: 6)  
  - [ ] Display workspacePath in popup footer  
- [ ] Enable local testing (AC: 5)  
  - [ ] Register command for sample popup trigger  
  - [ ] Verify rendering and input in dev mode  
- [ ] Write integration tests (AC: all) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]  
  - [ ] Test rendering, chime, and theme adaptation in tests/integration/popupFlow.test.ts  

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**: Build on MCP server from 1.3 for request handling; no specific notes from prior dev records.  
- **Data Models**: Use PopupRequest for rendering details (title, message, options). [Source: architecture/data-models.md#popuprequest]  
- **API Specifications**: N/A - Internal rendering, but integrates with MCP request handling. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]  
- **Component Specifications**: PopupWebview class with renderPopup() and getHtmlContent(); use WebviewPanel for tab. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template] [Source: architecture/components.md#popup-renderer]  
- **File Locations**: src/components/PopupWebview.ts, src/views/popup.html, src/utils/chimePlayer.ts; assets/chime.wav. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
- **Testing Requirements**: Jest + @vscode/test-electron for frontend unit/integration. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]  
- **Technical Constraints**: VS Code Extension API 1.85.x, custom HTML/CSS without heavy libs; ensure chime uses native audio. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-framework]  

**Project Structure Notes**: Follows frontend component organization; no discrepancies.

### Testing
- Test file location: tests/unit/components/ and tests/integration/ for popup tests. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]  
- Test standards: Testing pyramid with integration focus for UI flows. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]  
- Testing frameworks and patterns: Jest for component rendering; simulate webview messages. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-component-test]  
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Test all AC elements: rendering, styling, chime, debug display, local trigger.
