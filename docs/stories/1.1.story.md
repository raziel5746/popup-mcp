# Story 1.1: Implement Repository Setup and Initial Commit Processes

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** clear steps for repository initialization, including git setup, initial commit, and basic README,  
**so that** the project starts with proper version control and documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Define git init, .gitignore, and initial commit in extension setup.  
2. Include basic README with setup instructions.  
3. Integrate with Story 1.3 for seamless scaffolding.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize git repository (AC: 1)  
  - [ ] Run git init in the project root  
  - [ ] Create .gitignore file with standard patterns for Node.js projects, such as node_modules, dist, .env, etc. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]  
- [ ] Create basic README.md (AC: 2)  
  - [ ] Add section for project overview [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
  - [ ] Add setup instructions, including required tools and versions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]  
- [ ] Make initial commit (AC: 1)  
  - [ ] git add all initial files as per unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
  - [ ] git commit -m "Initial project setup"  
- [ ] Integrate with Story 1.3 scaffolding (AC: 3)  
  - [ ] Document integration with extension skeleton creation in README [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
- [ ] Setup testing structure (AC: all)  
  - [ ] Create tests/ directory with unit/ and integration/ subdirectories [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]  
  - [ ] Write basic integration test to verify project structure after setup [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#integration]

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**: No previous stories exist.  
- **Data Models**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.  
- **API Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.  
- **Component Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.  
- **File Locations**: Follow the unified project structure for all file placements, including:  
  - README.md at root  
  - .github/workflows/ for CI/CD yaml files  
  - src/ for source code  
  - tests/ for testing  
  - assets/ for static files like chime.wav  
  [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
- **Testing Requirements**: Adhere to the testing pyramid using Jest for unit and integration tests, Playwright for E2E. Organize tests in tests/unit/ and tests/integration/. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid and #test-organization]  
- **Technical Constraints**: Use TypeScript 5.3.x, Node.js 20.x LTS, esbuild 0.20.x, vsce latest, and other versions as specified. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]  

**Project Structure Notes**: The repository setup must align with the defined unified project structure. No discrepancies noted between epic requirements and architecture.

### Testing
- Test file location: tests/unit/ for unit tests, tests/integration/ for integration tests [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]  
- Test standards: Follow testing pyramid with emphasis on unit and integration for setup verification [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]  
- Testing frameworks and patterns: Use Jest with @vscode/test-electron for frontend, Jest for backend [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests and #backend-tests]  
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Include integration tests to verify the setup process and initial project structure.
