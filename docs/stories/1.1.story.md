# Story 1.1: Implement Repository Setup and Initial Commit Processes

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** clear steps for repository initialization, including git setup, initial commit, and basic README,  
**so that** the project starts with proper version control and documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Define git init, .gitignore, and initial commit in extension setup.  
2. Include basic README with setup instructions.  
3. Integrate with Story 1.3 for seamless scaffolding.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Initialize git repository (AC: 1)  
  - [x] Run git init in the project root  
  - [x] Create .gitignore file with standard patterns for Node.js projects, such as node_modules, dist, .env, etc. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]  
- [x] Create basic README.md (AC: 2)  
  - [x] Add section for project overview [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
  - [x] Add setup instructions, including required tools and versions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]  
- [x] Make initial commit (AC: 1)  
  - [x] git add all initial files as per unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
  - [x] git commit -m "Initial project setup"  
- [x] Integrate with Story 1.3 scaffolding (AC: 3)  
  - [x] Document integration with extension skeleton creation in README [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
- [x] Setup testing structure (AC: all)  
  - [x] Create tests/ directory with unit/ and integration/ subdirectories [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]  
  - [x] Write basic integration test to verify project structure after setup [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#integration]

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**: No previous stories exist.  
- **Data Models**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.  
- **API Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.  
- **Component Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.  
- **File Locations**: Follow the unified project structure for all file placements, including:  
  - README.md at root  
  - .github/workflows/ for CI/CD yaml files  
  - src/ for source code  
  - tests/ for testing  
  - assets/ for static files like chime.wav  
  [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]  
- **Testing Requirements**: Adhere to the testing pyramid using Jest for unit and integration tests, Playwright for E2E. Organize tests in tests/unit/ and tests/integration/. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid and #test-organization]  
- **Technical Constraints**: Use TypeScript 5.3.x, Node.js 20.x LTS, esbuild 0.20.x, vsce latest, and other versions as specified. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]  

**Project Structure Notes**: The repository setup must align with the defined unified project structure. No discrepancies noted between epic requirements and architecture.

### Testing
- Test file location: tests/unit/ for unit tests, tests/integration/ for integration tests [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]  
- Test standards: Follow testing pyramid with emphasis on unit and integration for setup verification [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]  
- Testing frameworks and patterns: Use Jest with @vscode/test-electron for frontend, Jest for backend [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests and #backend-tests]  
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Include integration tests to verify the setup process and initial project structure.

- Made initial commit with all setup files
- Created validation script to verify project structure integrity
- All acceptance criteria met and validated

### File List  
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns for Node.js projects
- `README.md` - Project overview and development setup guide
- `tests/` - Testing directory structure
  - `tests/unit/` - Unit test directory
  - `tests/integration/` - Integration test directory  
  - `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end test directory
- `tests/integration/project-structure.test.js` - Project structure validation script

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-10

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The initial repository setup is well-executed with a comprehensive README, appropriate .gitignore patterns, and basic testing structure validation. Minor improvements were made through refactoring to better align with testing standards.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: tests/integration/project-structure.test.ts
  - **Change**: Converted custom validation script to Jest test suite using describe/it/expect.
  - **Why**: To comply with the testing strategy that mandates Jest for unit and integration tests.
  - **How**: Enables automatic test discovery and running via npm test, improves readability, and eliminates custom assertion logic.

- **File**: README.md
  - **Change**: Updated the verification command from 'node ... .js' to 'npm test -- ... .ts'.
  - **Why**: Correct file extension mismatch and integrate with Jest runner instead of direct node execution.
  - **How**: Makes verification consistent with the project's testing framework and easier to maintain.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Followed naming conventions and structure; no major violations.
- Project Structure: ✓ Aligns with unified project structure for initial setup.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ After refactoring, uses Jest as specified for integration tests.
- All ACs Met: ✓ All criteria satisfied, with note on .js vs .ts in story file list.

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored validation script to Jest format
- [x] Updated README verification command
- [x] Verified all files and directories exist as specified
- [x] Confirmed git initialization and initial commit

### Security Review

No security concerns identified in setup files or validation script.

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues; test uses synchronous fs calls which are acceptable in test context.

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done
