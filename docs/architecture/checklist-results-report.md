# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Architecture Completeness**: 95% - Comprehensive for MVP, covering all key areas with clear, pragmatic choices; minor gaps in advanced features but solid foundation.
- **MVP Scope Appropriateness**: Just Right - Lightweight, extension-focused design matches PRD without overreach; enables quick iterations.
- **Readiness for Development**: Ready - Provides single source of truth; dev agents can proceed with confidence.
- **Most Critical Gaps or Concerns**: No DB but potential for local storage expansion; monitoring is basic—consider telemetry post-MVP for real-world insights.

## Category Analysis Table
| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| High-Level Design | PASS | None - Unified approach fits extension model well. |
| Tech Stack | PASS | None - Pragmatic, native choices; versions current. |
| Data Models/API | PASS | Minor: Add retry to error handling for robustness. |
| Components/Structure | PASS | None - Modular and clear. |
| Workflows/Security | PARTIAL | Add retry logic in error flow; expand perf metrics. |
| Testing/Deployment | PASS | None - Good coverage and automation. |
| Standards/Monitoring | PASS | None - Minimal but effective for MVP. |

## Top Issues by Priority
- **BLOCKERS**: None - Actionable as-is.
- **HIGH**: Implement basic retry for transient errors (e.g., routing timeouts) to enhance reliability.
- **MEDIUM**: Expand monitoring with optional telemetry for prod insights (with consent).
- **LOW**: Add more E2E tests for edge cases like chime muting.

## MVP Scope Assessment
- **Features that Might Be Cut**: None essential—all tie to core PRD.
- **Missing Features**: Advanced auth (not needed); cloud integration (out of scope).
- **Complexity Concerns**: Multi-instance routing—mitigated by tests/diagrams.
- **Timeline Realism**: Achievable in 1-2 months with the outlined structure.

## Technical Readiness
- **Clarity of Constraints**: High - Local, no-external-deps focus is clear.
- **Identified Risks**: VS Code API changes—flagged in brief; mitigated by stable versions.
- **Areas for Investigation**: Detailed multi-instance election algo; perf testing on low-end hardware.

## Recommendations
- **Actions**: Add retry to error handling; set up basic telemetry hooks.
- **Next Steps**: Shard into implementation tasks; begin dev with coding standards.
- **Overall**: Strong architecture—proceed to build!
