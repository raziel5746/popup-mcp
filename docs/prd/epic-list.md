# Epic List

1. **Epic 1: Foundation and Core Popup Functionality** - Establish the extension skeleton, MCP server setup, basic popup display (using HTML/CSS/TS in a tab), chime notification, and simple button response routing to deliver an initial working prototype for single-instance use.

2. **Epic 2: Multi-Instance Routing and Coordination** - Implement workspace path detection, server/client coordination across multiple VS Code instances, and accurate popup routing (requiring AI to include workspace path) to enable reliable interactions in complex setups.

3. **Epic 3: UI Enhancements and Polish** - Add configurable settings for popups (e.g., chime mute, themes), status bar indicators with hover details and mute button, accessibility features, and full integration testing to complete the MVP with a polished user experience.
