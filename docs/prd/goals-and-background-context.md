# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable AI coding assistants to trigger interactive popup dialogs in VS Code for structured user responses, reducing context switching.
- Provide accurate popup routing across multiple VS Code instances using workspace path detection.
- Support both HTTP and stdio protocols with zero-configuration setup.
- Enhance overall coding efficiency by transforming AIs into interactive pair programmers through button-based interactions.

### Background Context
In the current AI-assisted coding landscape, assistants like GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, and Cline are confined to chat-based interactions, leading to workflow disruptions during critical decision-making moments. Developers experience cognitive overload from context switching to type responses, which can reduce efficiency by up to 40%. This extension addresses these issues by enabling popups that allow for quick, structured decisions without breaking focus.

The solution introduces an MCP server within VS Code that handles popup requests, routes them to the correct instance based on workspace paths, and captures button responses seamlessly. Popups will include customizable buttons and an option for free text input, allowing users to provide responses not covered by predefined options. This innovation positions AIs as true pair programmers, supporting use cases like architecture choices, deployment confirmations, and learning interactions, ultimately creating a more immersive coding experience.
