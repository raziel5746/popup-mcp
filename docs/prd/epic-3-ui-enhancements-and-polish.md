# Epic 3: UI Enhancements and Polish

Expanded Goal: This final epic enhances the user interface with configurable settings, accessibility features, and thorough testing to polish the extension. It completes the MVP by adding user controls for popups (like chime muting and basic themes), ensuring WCAG AA compliance, and validating the full system through integration testing, resulting in a robust, user-friendly product ready for release.

### Story 3.1: Implement Configurable Settings
As a user, I want extension settings for customizing popup behaviors, including chime on/off, frequency caps, and auto-dismiss rules, so that I can tailor the experience to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1: Adds settings panel with options for chime toggle, popup limits, and other behaviors.
2: Settings persist and apply immediately.
3: Integrates with status bar mute button for chime.
4: Documents settings in README or help command.

### Story 3.2: Enhance Accessibility Features
As a user with accessibility needs, I want the popup to meet WCAG AA standards, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high-contrast modes, so that the extension is inclusive.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1: Implements keyboard navigation for buttons and text input.
2: Ensures screen reader compatibility (e.g., ARIA labels).
3: Tests with high-contrast themes and diverse setups.
4: Validates against WCAG AA checklist.

### Story 3.3: Add Theme Integration and Polish
As a user, I want popups to integrate with VS Code themes while maintaining a distinct AI style, with options for future custom themes, so that the UI feels cohesive yet noticeable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1: Syncs popup style with VS Code themes without clashes.
2: Applies modern minimalistic AI look as specified.
3: Prepares hooks for future theme selection (not implemented in MVP).
4: Visual testing across OSes and themes.

### Story 3.4: Conduct Full Integration Testing and Polish
As a developer, I want comprehensive integration tests covering all features, including multi-instance scenarios, chime, routing, and configs, so that the MVP is stable and ready for release.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1: Writes integration tests for end-to-end flows.
2: Includes manual testing for UI interactions and edge cases.
3: Fixes any discovered bugs and polishes UX based on testing.
4: Achieves 95% popup success rate in tests.
5: Install and configure testing frameworks (e.g., Mocha/Jest) early in Epic 1 if needed.
6: Define mock services for multi-instance and edge case testing.

### Story 3.5: Enhance User and Developer Documentation
As a user/developer, I want comprehensive guides for using and extending the popup-mcp extension, so that handoff and adoption are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1: Expand README with user guides (e.g., settings, troubleshooting).
2: Add dev docs for API handlers and integration points.
3: Include error handling examples and onboarding flows.
