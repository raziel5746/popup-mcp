# Checklist Results Report

### Executive Summary
- **Overall PRD Completeness**: 92% - The document is comprehensive, well-structured, and covers most essential elements with clear requirements and epics.
- **MVP Scope Appropriateness**: Just Right - The scope is minimal yet viable, focused on core functionality with logical incremental epics that deliver value without overreach.
- **Readiness for Architecture Phase**: Ready - The PRD provides sufficient detail and constraints for the architect to proceed, with minor gaps in validation areas that can be addressed during design.
- **Most Critical Gaps or Concerns**: Limited coverage of data requirements (no data entities needed, but could specify if any local storage is used); some non-functional requirements could be more quantifiable (e.g., exact resource limits).

### Category Analysis Table

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS    | None - Strong problem statement and goals aligned with brief. |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | None - Clear boundaries and validation criteria. |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PASS    | None - Detailed UX vision with rationale. |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | Minor: Some ACs could include more testability details. |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PARTIAL | Performance metrics good, but security could specify threat models. |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | None - Well-sequenced with vertical slices. |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | None - Clear assumptions and rationale. |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Data section minimal (appropriate for project); integrations well-covered. |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | None - Consistent, well-organized document. |

### Top Issues by Priority
- **BLOCKERS**: None identified - PRD is actionable.
- **HIGH**: Enhance non-functional requirements with more specific metrics (e.g., exact CPU/memory thresholds for NFR4).
- **MEDIUM**: Add explicit data entity definitions if local storage expands (currently none, but for future-proofing).
- **LOW**: Include diagrams for user flows in UX section for better visualization.

### MVP Scope Assessment
- **Features that Might Be Cut**: None essential— all tie to core value; if needed, defer advanced config options to post-MVP.
- **Missing Features**: Basic analytics for popup usage (out of scope, as per brief).
- **Complexity Concerns**: Multi-instance routing (Epic 2) may have edge cases; testing story in Epic 3 mitigates.
- **Timeline Realism**: With small stories, achievable in 3 months assuming part-time effort.

### Technical Readiness
- **Clarity of Technical Constraints**: High - Monorepo, monolith, languages specified clearly.
- **Identified Technical Risks**: VS Code API changes, multi-instance edge cases—flagged for validation.
- **Areas Needing Architect Investigation**: Detailed routing mechanism, chime implementation (WAV playback), and ID generation for multi-AI support.

### Recommendations
- **Actions for Blockers**: N/A.
- **Suggested Improvements**: Quantify NFRs further; add a simple data model if storage needs grow.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed to architecture phase; review with stakeholders for final alignment.
