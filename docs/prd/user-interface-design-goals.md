# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The extension aims to provide a seamless, non-intrusive UI that integrates naturally with VS Code, minimizing disruption while enabling quick AI interactions via popups. Popups will be built using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript/JavaScript, displayed in a new VS Code tab rather than native modals. The focus is on low-friction, context-preserving decision-making that feels like a natural part of the editor experience, with safeguards against over-intrusiveness.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- Modal popup dialogs for immediate, structured decisions with customizable buttons and free text input.
- Passive status bar indicator for MCP connection state without requiring user attention.
- Automatic server/client coordination with graceful handling of edge cases.
- Zero-configuration setup, leveraging VS Code APIs for workspace detection.
- User-configurable settings for popup behavior (e.g., frequency caps, auto-dismiss rules, theme integration) to prevent workflow disruptions.
- Configurable chime notification for popups, toggleable via status bar and settings.

### Core Screens and Views
- Popup Dialog: A modal window with title, message, action buttons, and optional text input field.
- Status Bar Item: A persistent icon indicator showing MCP role and connection status, with detailed text on hover; includes a mute/unmute button for popup chime.
- Settings Panel: Extension settings for customizing popup behaviors, preferences, and chime on/off option.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Standard accessibility compliance to ensure usability for a broad range of developers, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support for popups, and testing across diverse user setups.

### Branding
Implement a custom, modern, and minimalistic AI-looking style for popups to make them distinguishable from the rest of the IDE, while ensuring they do not clash with VS Code themes.

### Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform
VS Code desktop on Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring consistent experience across operating systems with platform-specific testing.

**Detailed Rationale:**
- **Trade-offs and Choices**: Opted for minimal UI elements to keep the extension lightweight, choosing popups over more complex interfaces to avoid overwhelming the user. Selected WCAG AA over AAA to balance accessibility with development effort for MVP, while adding configurable settings to mitigate intrusiveness risks.
- **Key Assumptions**: Assumed integration with VS Code's existing UI components will suffice; based on project brief's emphasis on desktop VS Code environments. Assumes early testing will validate multi-platform consistency.
- **Interesting Decisions**: Limited core views to popup, status bar, and settings to prioritize simplicity, with configurability added to address potential over-use; chose cross-platform without mobile support as VS Code is primarily desktop.
- **Areas Needing Validation**: Confirm if additional accessibility features are needed; custom themes or theme selection will be required in future versions but not for MVP; verify if status bar and configs are sufficient for all status information; conduct beta testing for intrusiveness and edge cases.
