# Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Popup MCP's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas
- **VS Code Developers (Primary Persona):** Software developers and engineers using VS Code as their primary IDE, experienced with AI-assisted coding tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor. They work in multi-project setups, need quick structured inputs to maintain flow, and face pains from context switching during decisions. Goals: Boost productivity with seamless AI collaborations.

#### Usability Goals
- Ease of learning: New users can understand and respond to popups within seconds without documentation.
- Efficiency of use: Interactions resolve in under 10 seconds with minimal clicks or typing.
- Error prevention: Clear messaging and confirmations for any ambiguous routing or failures.
- Memorability: Consistent patterns that align with VS Code's UI for infrequent users.

#### Design Principles
1. **Simplicity and Non-Intrusiveness:** Prioritize minimal disruption to coding flow with lightweight, dismissible popups.
2. **Seamless Integration:** Match VS Code's theming and behaviors for a native feel.
3. **Immediate Feedback:** Provide clear responses to user actions, like confirmations or error handling.
4. **Accessibility First:** Ensure keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and configurable options from the start.
5. **Reliability in Context:** Handle multi-instance scenarios gracefully to build user trust.
