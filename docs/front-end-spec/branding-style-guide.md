# Branding & Style Guide

### Visual Identity

**Brand Guidelines:** Align with VS Code's modern, developer-focused aesthetic; no existing company guidelines assumedâ€”emphasize clean, AI-inspired elements like subtle blues and gradients for a futuristic feel. Include a pulsating blueish glow effect around modals to make them pop and enhance the AI-ish appearance.

### Color Palette

| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Primary | #007ACC | Main accents, buttons, links (VS Code blue for familiarity) |
| Secondary | #1E1E1E | Backgrounds, text (dark mode neutral) |
| Accent | #3C3C3C | Hover states, borders |
| Success | #2E7D32 | Confirmation messages |
| Warning | #F9A825 | Alerts, chime toggle |
| Error | #D32F2F | Error states, invalid inputs |
| Neutral | #CCCCCC | Disabled elements, placeholders |
| Modal Background | #070809 | Background color behind the modal for depth and contrast |

### Typography

#### Font Families
- **Primary:** 'Segoe UI', system-ui (VS Code default for consistency)
- **Secondary:** 'Arial', sans-serif (fallback)
- **Monospace:** 'Consolas', monospace (for code snippets if needed)

#### Type Scale

| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| H1 | 24px | Bold | 1.5 |
| H2 | 18px | Semi-bold | 1.4 |
| H3 | 14px | Regular | 1.3 |
| Body | 12px | Regular | 1.5 |
| Small | 10px | Regular | 1.2 |

### Iconography

**Icon Library:** VS Code's built-in icons (e.g., from vscode-icons). For chime: Use VS Code's music icon (unmuted) and mute icon (muted) to avoid conflict with notification bells.

**Usage Guidelines:** Use sparingly; ensure scalability and theme adaptability; alt text for accessibility.

### Spacing & Layout

**Grid System:** Flexible grid based on VS Code's layout (e.g., 8px base unit).

**Spacing Scale:** 4px (xs), 8px (sm), 16px (md), 24px (lg), 32px (xl) for margins/padding.
